# OCTOoNFTs
In Ethereum we have NFT (Non Fungible Token) standards for example ERC721 and it's great, but you don't have any private data or transfers, our idea is create standard oERC721 using the OPL (Oasis Privacy Layer) and make it so you can have public URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and private URI, while also being able to make it public to a whitelisted address, for a time limit and also with a revoke option.

Also we had to modify the ledger and transfer methods to add privacy and avoid data leakage.
